        <p>Semantic HTML refers to html tags that convey the meaning or 'semantics' of the content within them.  While it is possible to use the generic 'div' and 'span' for all of the elements on a page, that doesn't tell the web browser or anyone reading the code anything about whats going on on the page.  Many users have imparements and must rely on a web reader or other accessibility feature in order to fully utilize the web.  These features make use of semantic html to properly work.  As a web developer it is important to use semantic html for these reasons.</p>

        <h3><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></h3>
        <p>The nav tag is used to hold the navigation links for the website.</p>
        
        <h3><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></h3>
        <p>A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.  An example would be a 'blog posts' section on a page.  The whole page isn't about the blog posts, just that one section.</p>
        
        <h3><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></h3>
        <p>An article is a piece of indepentdent self-contained content.  Each individual blog post within the 'blog posts' section would be an article.</p>
        
        <h3><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></h3>
        <p>The aside tag is for content that is aside from the content it is placed in.  A sidebar with ads or related posts, is an example of an aside.</p>
        
        <h3><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></h3>
        <p>The footer is for the information at the bottom of the page.  This generally will include some navigation, location information, coyright information, etc...</p>
        
        <h3><code>&lt;figure&gt;</code></h3>
        <p>The figure element is meant to wrap around an image element and a 'figcaption' element.</p>
        
        <h3><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></h3>
        <p>This is the tag for putting images into a web page.</p>
        
        <h3><code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code></h3>
        <p>This tag is used for adding a caption to an image.  It is used in conjunction with the 'figure' and 'img' tags.</p>
        
        <h3><code>&lt;a&gt;</code></h3>
        <p>The 'a' tag is for creating links.</p>
        
        <h3><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></h3>
        <p>This tag is for creating buttons.  Many times the 'a' tag is used instead and styled to look like a button. The difference is 'a' or anchor tags are meant to be links to take users to different locations or pages.  Buttons are meant for submitting information, not necessarily redirecting the user to a different web page.</p>
        
        <h3><code>&lt;!-- comment text here... --&gt;</code></h3>
